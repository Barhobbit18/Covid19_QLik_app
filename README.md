# Covid19_QLik_app
 
so here is a good example of procrastination. I was actually busy looking for large json file on the internet for my snowflake practising. Bit boring with same information. So any way I came a cross this covid19 API. Aaaaaand Qlik sense was open so I played around with it. Nothing wow, just map and tree sheets. But nice place to find 400k lines Script loader as all the details
